Welcome to ExsanguinatorRL's documentation!
===========================================

Introduction
++++++++++++
Welcome to the documentation for our project, ExsanguinatorRL! ExsanguinatorRL, as the name implies, is a traditional roguelike game. The code is heavily based on the Python Roguelike tutorial at http://rogueliketutorials.com/.

You play as a blood sorcerer on a quest for power and glory. Fight your way through a dark and unforgiving dungeon! Hack all living creatures you find into bloody gore! And above all; feast!

Division of Labour and Git
==========================
Neither of us knows what they or the other did during the course of this project. We worked together on making this project
a reality, and the specifics have been lost on us. That said, we've been using git since day one, and would hence like
to refer you to the commit history which can be found here: https://bit.ly/2ZCTCBV

Of course, the game can therefore also be found on github, here: https://bit.ly/2J3KbVu
