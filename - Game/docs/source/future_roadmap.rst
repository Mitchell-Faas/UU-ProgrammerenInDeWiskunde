Future Roadmap
========

There are a number of features that we would have liked to implement, but have not gotten around to.
Some of these may still be implemented in future versions.

Multiple Dungeon Floors
+++++++++++++++++++++++
Ideally our dungeon would consist of multiple levels. One would descend one level at a time using stairs.
Regular levels could be interspersed with boss rooms (the basic functionality for making boss rooms is already present.)
The difficulty of the dungeon would scale with depth, as would some other things, like the quality of loot.
Eventually the game would end at a certain depth, once all bosses have been defeated.

Spells
++++++
One of the most important core features of our design, spell-casting, is not yet implemented in the current version of the game.
The idea was to have a system where casting spells costs Blood, the equivalent of hp. This means one would have to use
spells sparingly and as efficiently as possible. Spells could be unlocked by finding the related spellbook, and then
paying Blood to add that spell to one's arsenal.

Saving and Loading
++++++++++++++++++
Saving and loading functionality, while not strictly necessary, would drastically improve the game, especially when
its length becomes longer due to multiple-level dungeons.

Equipment
+++++++++
We would like to add equipment to directly augment one's combative ability. This would be the second type of item,
in addition to consumables. It would also be desirable to add a larger variety of items in general.

Miscellaneous
+++++++++++++
There are numerous small miscellaneous improvements to be made. A help menu with  a list of controls, a title menu, and
more extensive and informative UI are a few examples. Depending on time constraints it may be worthwhile to also implement
all of these.
