Welcome to ExsanguinatorRL's documentation!
===========================================

Introduction
++++++++++++
Welcome to the documentation for our project, ExsanguinatorRL! ExsanguinatorRL, as the name implies, is a traditional roguelike game. The code is heavily based on the Python Roguelike tutorial at http://rogueliketutorials.com/.

You play as a blood sorcerer, on a quest for power and glory. Fight your way through a dark and unforgiving dungeon! Decimate the monsters that spawn there, and use their blood against them! And above all; feast!
