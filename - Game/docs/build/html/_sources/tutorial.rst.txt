Controls
++++++++

Use the numpad keys to move. Make sure numlock is on. Alternatively use VI keys (k, j, h, l, y, u, b, n).
Bump into enemies to attack them.
Use numpad 5 or “.” to wait a turn.
When standing on an item, use ‘g’ to pick it up.
Press ‘i’ to show the inventory. When in the inventory, press the letter next to an item to use it.
Press ‘d’ to show the drop menu. When in the drop menu, press the letter next to an item to drop it.
When in a menu, press escape to exit. Pressing escape outside of a menu will close the game.

Gameplay
++++++++
You spawn in a dungeon. Move around until you find enemies. They will often appear in groups, so it might be wise to lure them into a hallway to fight them one by one. An enemy, once defeated, will drop a blood crystal. Make sure to pick these up. Using them gives you some health, so use them before you die!
In the current version of the game, the goal is to destroy all enemies on the floor. There is no win-screen. You have eternity to reflect on your deeds. Or alternatively, until you close the game.
